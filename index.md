# A Critique of New BattleTabs Ships - Part 1

Over the past few months, BattleTabs has seen a variety of new ships enter Battle Club heartland. But of course, as one ship comes in, another goes out, and we’ve found ourselves in a situation where both subscribers and non-subscribers have new ships to enjoy and use. In fact, I believe that the fact that the community votes on which ship leaves is what makes BattleTabs *not* pay to win. In the months between October and December, I’ll be looking at each of the new ships, both to the public and to the Club, and I’ll be explaining what I think is important in making new ships. 

In this month’s article, I’ll be looking at the ships that have been released to the public, how they work, their ups and downs, and strategies to play with and against them. 

## Electric Eels
Description: Reveal the entire target ship. Cannot be used on hit tiles. 
CD: 3

Eel, as I’m going to call it, is a rather balanced ship, although it isn’t used nearly as much as when it was first released to the public. Eel is quite effective when used in combination with Longboat, Galleon and other precision ships. It can be both a low and high-skill ship. 

### Pros: 
- Can be both low and high-skill 
- Coordinates well 
- Versatile (Get it?) shape 

### Cons: 
- Ability is somewhat passive 
- Awkward CD 
- Doesn’t work on hit tiles 

### Strats with: 
- Use this ship in conjunction with a revealer as well as a multi-attack ship 
- Don’t use it randomly and waste the ability 
- Don’t use it as another revealer for your coracle, you’d be surprised at how useless this is 

### Strats against: 
- Use a small CD revealer to try to eliminate the other ships 
- Don’t randomly attack, play with counterplay 

Overall, I’d give Eel a balance rating of 4/5. 

## Magic Mirror 
Description: Use the ability last played by your opponent 
CD: 5 

Mirror is a good ship, although its long CD and simple shape are easy to play against. Perhaps its biggest advantage is that it is one of three truly versatile ships in BattleTabs, the other two being Crustacean and Slug Squad. It is also a good ship against coracle fleets. 

### Pros: 
- Highly versatile 
- Great ship for counterplay 
- Good against Coracle 

### Cons: 
- Long CD 
- Easy to play against 

### Strats with: 
- Use this ship in conjunction with a revealer 
- Use this ship with a semiheavy ship, and NEVER (I mean it) use Mirror as a primary attacker 

### Strats against: 
- Try to destroy the mirror before your opponent can use its ability 
- Try to apply the ability that will least benefit your opponent 

I think Mirror is a balanced ship, so like Eel I’m giving it a 4/5 balance rating. 

## Crustacean 
Description: In an X pattern, reveal hidden tiles and attack revealed tiles. 
CD: 3 

Crusty is, as mentioned before, a highly versatile ship. It can be used as both a revealer and an attacker, and it’s firing pattern gives it a large sweep. However, it’s easily countered by Eel and Longboat, and can often be easily found due to its size. 

### Pros: 
- Shape 
- Highly versatile 
- Short CD

### Cons: 
- Bulky 
- Countered by Eel and Longboat 

### Strats with: 
- Play as a normal revealer  
- Don’t forget that Crusty can attack as well as reveal 

### Strats against: 
- Use a revealer to find it 
- Try to use Longboat on this, a Coracle shot would be better used somewhere else 

Crusty is a highly balanced ship, with only one problem: people use it wrong! I’d give it a balance rating of 4.5/5. 

## See Slug 
Description: Reveal tiles until you reveal successfully, with a maximum of four reveals. 
CD: 2 

See Slug is the latest ship to be released. It has, in my opinion, an OP ability, and it’s also very tanky. Given that if you miss a reveal, it’s the same as if you miss a cannonball attack, and if you reveal successfully, it’s worth about half a cannonball (because you could attack it on the next turn), See Slug’s ability can give you anywhere between 1.5 to 5 cannonballs in two turns. This is very powerful, given that you can intentionally miss. 

### Pros: 
- OP ability 
- Confusing shape 

### Cons: 
- Easy to find 

### Strats with: 
- Use it as a normal revealer 
- Intentionally miss to give you an edge in the endgame 

### Strats against: 
- Use semiheavy ships as well as Slug Squad to try to eliminate their ships 

Overall, See Slug is quite unbalanced, so I would suggest limiting it to three reveals. I’d give it a balance rating of 2.5/5. 

Next month, I’ll look at the newest Battle Club ships and how you can combat them. See you until then!

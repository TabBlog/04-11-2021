# Sonar: The most underrated weapon in BattleTabs

Over the past few months, BattleTabs has seen several ships enter the limelight. With the current meta mainly focused on Coracle, it seems that one of the most important aspects of BattleTabs, sonar, is beginning to fade away. A month and a half or so ago, we would have seen nearly every fleet containing some sort of sonar. Nowadays, you'll often play with or against fleets with basically revealer-revealer-Coracle-Longboat. What many people miss is the power of sonar, even if it doesn't stick around. 

With sonar, you can reveal many tiles. Even though the primary focus of sonar is to find where ships can be, one other aspect is to find where ships can't be. This can save a lot of time when you get to the endgame, when only one ship remains on each side. It's especially good for coracle hunting, because if you sonar in the right place, you can often get at least a three, which is 13 tiles ruled out. Pair this with the low cooldowns of the sonar ships, and sonar is unmatched.
